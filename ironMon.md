# The IronMON Challenge

The IronMon challenge is a [Pokémon Randomizer](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases)
Challenge run created by [Iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie). Designed to make experiencing the randomizer
fun and challenging, while taking away the wild Pokémon grind that come with some other challenges. It was originally
made for Fire Red / Leaf Green but the rules can be applied/adjusted for other games as well. If you're interested to
find out more about IronMon, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/jFPYsZAhjX)!

IronMon has varying levels of difficulties, to keep it more approachable but also provide the toughest challenge
possible for those who want it.

### Kaizo IronMon Ruleset

These additional rules are meant to be insanely stupid and hard. These are not meant to be fair, and possibly not even
fun. But if you are truly someone who wants an impossible challenge, this is for you. These rules are also
non-negotiable. If you wish to adjust rules just play Standard Ironmon and Ultimate as your ruleset.
